Although I originally went to school and studied psychology, and then worked in the far-removed field of video engineering, I nonetheless found myself speeding through a 3-year dash to finish two CS degrees and soak up everything I possibly could about software development. I had been brought there by a long-building dissatisfaction in what I had done with my life so far, and passions of my younger self re-ignited by my first, tentative steps back into programming in well over a decade.

That passion served me well â€” I took on elaborate projects, published papers, and built software to assist teaching CS courses. Even before graduating, I was cutting my teeth on APIs, web apps and sentiment analysis at social media startup [Gremln](https://gremln.com), at first from a cramped table at Starbucks, then at the first startup incubator in St. Louis.

A fundraising trip brought me to San Francisco and Silicon Valley, and with that the clear impression that moving here was my only next step. Barely two months later, I drove across the US to San Francisco, finding an apartment at the edge of the Tenderloin, and a small, sharp team of colleagues at [Circa](https://cir.ca).

My professional pursuits have since led me more deeply into open-source development, architecture, distributed systems and functional programming; my life here has placed me in one of the focal points of an emerging collision of technologies, ideas and cultures whose effects are only just beginning to be felt around the world.

I can usually be found watching or reading science-fiction and horror, listening to electronic music, playing RPG and strategy games, or just cycling around and beyond the city. But always, I'm hacking away at a project or otherwise learning about something new in tech.
