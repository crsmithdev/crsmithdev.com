The Hotel Gracery is located in [Kabukichō, Tokyo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kabukich%C5%8D,_Tokyo), just northeast of Shinjuku station. It looks something like an Alienware [tower](http://www.alienware.com/landings/desktops.aspx), especially when viewed from the street as pictured above. Notably, the cinema attached to the hotel features a [full-size Godzilla head](http://en.rocketnews24.com/2014/12/11/full-size-godzilla-head-to-terrorize-moviegoers-and-hotel-guests-in-tokyo-starting-next-spring/) which can be seen peeking over the rooftop.

The hotel charges extra for ‘Godzilla-view’ rooms.
