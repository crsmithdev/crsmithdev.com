# Arrow

Arrow is a simple, lightweight Python library, inspired by [moment.js](https://github.com/timrwood/moment) and [requests](https://github.com/kennethreitz/requests), that provides a sensible, intelligent way of creating, manipulating, formatting and converting dates, times and timestamps.  Arrow is a drop-in replacement for Python date objects.
