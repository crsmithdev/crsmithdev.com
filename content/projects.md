# Goenv

Goenv is a Go package that provides virtualenv-like functionality for Go projects, isolating dependencies into workspaces for safer and simpler management.

- Similar functionality to Python's virtualenv and virtualenvwrapper.
- Separates development directory from import path - e.g., develop in `~/myproject`, but import from `github.com/me/myproject`
- Isolates dependencies from other projects.
- Does not interfere with any `go` command functionality.
- Written in Go, installable with `go get`.
